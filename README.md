# UK Employment Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes the UK Employment dataset to uncover key insights into employment trends across industries, sub-industries, and cities. Using **Tableau**, I have created interactive visualizations to showcase:
- **Top 10 Industries** by employment.
- **Top 10 Sub-Industries** with the highest employment figures.
- **Symbol Map** illustrating the **average employment change by city**.

These insights are valuable for policymakers, businesses, and job seekers looking to understand the employment landscape in the UK.
